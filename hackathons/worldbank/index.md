# Objectives

1. Create custom 2D scatter plot visualizations of World Bank indicators
2. Optmize visualizations for large public displays

# Prerequisites

* [Week 8 Learning Challenge](/challenges/8)

# Team

The class will be divided into two teams. Team assignment will be faciliated by the teaching staff.

# Objective 1: Create custom visualizations

Pick any two dimensions (e.g., GDP and Infant Mortality Rate). Assign them to X and Y axes. Then, the challenge is how to represent other attributes of each data point using color, size, text, shape, or custom visual markers. Be creative! This custom visualization should be something not possible with Tableau.

## Brain Storming
First, use pen and paper to sketch your design. Come up with several sketches. Each two people on the team should come up with a design sketch independently. Submit ALL initial design sketches (use your cellphone to take pictures).

## Convergence
Second, as a team, review the sketches. Discuss how to integrate the best ideas. Converge to TWO designs. Submit both final design sketches. 

## Implementation
Third, as a team, implement the two designs in D3. Given the large team size, it is possible the team can be divided into two half teams, and each half team is responsible for implementing one design. This is just a suggestion. Your team can freely decide how to manage this task. Submit two D3 documents/code.

# Objective 2:  Public display visualizations

Test your team's visualization on a large display. Make any change necessary to make the visualization each to read and understand for people who may walk by the display.

# Presentation

During presentation, members from another team will "walk by" or "stand in front of" your team's visualization work, which should be projected on the large display assigned to your team.
