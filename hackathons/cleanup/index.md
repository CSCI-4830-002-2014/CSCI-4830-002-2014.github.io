Submit screenshots of the Facet/Filter widget above that displays your cleaned up data.

In addition, create one visualization (e.g., Bar Chart or Pie Chart) to present your results. You can use any software you already know how to use (e.g., Excel).

# Objective 2: Clean up the Muscian Dataset

Your goal is to figure out "Is the 27 club real?"

This question is based on [this section](http://enipedia.tudelft.nl/wiki/Google_Refine_Tutorial#More_Data_Sets_-_Is_the_27_Club_Real.3F) of the Google Refine tutorial you worked on. It provides some tips on how you should clean up this data.

Write a short sentence to explain your answer. Add a visulziation to support your answer.

# Presentation

Your team will do a 5 minutes presentation to the entire class about the findings from your analyses.
