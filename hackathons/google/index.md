* Analysis: Make sense of the ecosystem of existing Google Drive apps using big data tools.
* Data App: Propose a useful app your team could build (if given a week's time).
* Presentation: Share your findings and present your app idea

# Team

Work with your project team!

# App Ideas

Some ideas for an app to get your team thinking ...

* File browser
* ZIP extraction utility
* Recommendation system

Some other APIs you could consider using ...

# Deliverables

* Analysis:
	* Visualizations
	* Queries / Answers
	* Discussions

* Data app:
	* Mockup (screenshots or drawings)
	* Use cases (one or two examples how a user would use your app)
	* API uses (specific Google APIs you will need to use to make the app)
	* Implementation plan (how your team would build this app if given sufficient time)
