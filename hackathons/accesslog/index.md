# Dataset

Access Log in Splunk's Tutorial Dataset

[Download Page on Splunk's Website](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.1.3/PivotTutorial/GetthetutorialdataintoSplunk)

You are expected to have downloaded and worked with it prior to this hackathon.

# Objective

Make recommendations for a promotional campaign for ONE product (identified by Product ID) and a loyalty program to a small number of customers (identified by Client IP). Use data to rationalize and explain your recommendations.

# Prerequisites

* [Week 1 Learning Challenge](/challenges/1)
* [Week 2 Learning Challenge](/challenges/2)

# Team

Form a team of four or five with other classmates. You should work with others who are already sitting at the same table. The teaching staff will walk around to facilitate team forming. Introduce yourself if you do not already know each other.

# Discussion Points

For your promotional campaign, consider the following:

* Which _single_ product to promote?
* Why? (in terms of the benefits to the company)
* When? (week day, hour)
* What? Discount? Coupon? Buy one get one free? Or others inspired by what you've seen before?

For your loyalty program, consider the following:

* Who should be targeted?
* Why? (in terms of the benefits to the company)
* How does one quality? (in terms of behaviors)
* What perks and rewards can be offered to the customers in the program?

These are some points we suggest your team to consider. You can discuss these points in any order or expand your discussion to other important things you wish to consider.

# Deliverables

* A brief description for a promotional campaign and a customer loyalty program
* Screenshots of search result tables and graphs 
* Associated Splunk queries

# Presentation

Your team will do a 3-5 minutes presentation to the entire class about your recommendations. Even though your team is tasked to come up with both, there is only enough time to present either a promotional campaign or a loyalty program. Which one will be determined randomly at the presentation time.

# Submission

Use a Github repository to submit your work. Follow [this link] to a template repository we've created for the hackathon. Fork, modify, commit, push, and make a pull request, just like what you did for your other homework submissions.
