# Datasets

You should already have both of these datasets.  Refer to
[Challenge Week 12 for Weather Data](https://csci-4830-002-2014.github.io/units/weather_data/) and [the Yelp Hackathon](https://csci-4830-002-2014.github.io/hackathons/yelp/).

# Repository 

Submit your answers [here](add later)

# Teams

Get into teams of 4 or 5 for this hackathon.  You select your team.  Do it ASAP so we can get started :)

# Small Group Discussion

We are going to give you 15 minutes to discuss the following questions as a group.  Don't linger to long on a given question, reason through a simple answer and move on.  We'll discuss these as a group before starting the hackathon:

- Data questions
	* How could the weather be affecting what you find in the yelp dataset? (Explain)
	* Could the yelp dataset have any affect on the weather dataset?
	* What insights would you be able to get from the yelp dataset?  How could these be enhanced by connecting them to the weather dataset? 
- Methods Questions
	* What variables may contain useful cross-correlations between the two datasets?
	* What if you used the texts of the reviews instead of just the ratings?  How could this change what you analyze?
- Bias
	- What bias may exist in the datasets?
	- What if we told you only yelp reviews >3 were in the dataset?  How would this change what you could learn from it?
	- How would we workaround the kinds of biases listed in the above two questions?

# Hackathon Objectives 
1. Try to analyze how weather might affect yelp reviews 
2. Consider visualizations for showing this relationship
3. Try and tell a story with your findings
4. Look for another relationship in this dataset

# Objective 1: Analyze
Start by choosing a location to analyze, and choose 5 days that were rainy and 5 days that were sunny:

* Pull the weather data for those days
* Pull the Yelp reviews for those days
* Is the average review on each data correlated to the precipitation?
* Is it correlated to the temperature?
* Hypothesize how you'd be able to make your conclusions stronger.  Tell us about the potential biases and weaknesses given the current analysis.

# Objective 2: Visualize
Think about how you'd visualize this relationship:

* What visualizations would be helpful for showing this correlation?
* Which would NOT be useful? 

# Objective 3: Tell a story

Take the analysis you did in Objective 1 and implement a visualization from Objective 2.  Use these statistics and graphics to write up a small story that would convince a reader of what you've found.  Imagine you're being asked to do a (small) writeup for a newspaper or magazine.

# Objective 4: Dig Deeper

With whatever time you have left, go through this workflow again, but seek out a different correlation that your group has found or wants to see if it exists.  Start by telling us why you chose this correlation.  

No need to submit everything for Objective 1 & 2.  Do your analysis and skip straight to choosing a visualization and writing up a story.
