In this course, we plan to cover some basics of machine learning in big data, taking a high-level, user-centric perspective.

This week, you will participate in a study of a mobile app. The study will take 15-20 minutes. We want everyone to contribute. Later in the semester, we will have learning challenges and hackathons to look at this data together.
