<p>If you have a question about a particular learning challenge topic, project milestone, or hackathon, use the Diqus forum on the course website. Each topic page should have its own dedicated Disqus forum. Your question can then get answered by other students and the teaching staff. If you have a question you wish to discuss in private, email the teaching staff.</p>
