## Regrading

If you believe you have been incorrectly graded on a qualitative value assignment/question (e.g., report section, essay question), then within 48 hours of receiving the graded you must email me a grammatically correct, spell checked < 250 word grade rebuttal explaining how your assignment/question was incorrectly graded and how your answer is correct. Simply saying, “I believe I deserve a B because my question is good enough” or “I need a B to be a doctor” will not be accepted. After 48 hours, no regrading request on qualitative value assignment/questions will be accepted.

If you are incorrectly graded on a quantitative value assignment/question (e.g., the answer was 2 and you wrote 2), then you may see me before or after class to fix your grade within one week your grade was initially given. After one week, no regrading on quantitative value assignment/questions will be allowed.
