# Objectives
- Develop a project or research question that requires data collection
- Collect original data from the environment around us
- Collect data from online sources
- Clean and analyze our first-hand data
- Visualize and present data in any format (i.e., creative presentation, essay, infographic)

# Mini Project
- Learn hardware basics
- Collect small amount of data from a single sensor
- Utilize data to learn basics of data cleansing and analysis

# Proposing your course project (steps to follow)
- Come up with a few areas of interest (e.g., environment, education, agriculture, etc.)
- Find a few other people who share one of these interests
- Determine what you want the final result to look like 
- Collect original data using hardware you've built
- Pull in data from other sources to enrich your findings and analysis
- Decide how you'll present everything
- Ask Mike or Tom for any guidance!

# Real Project
- Will be proposed, negotiated and approved through Mike
- Includes 4 self-imposed milestones that will be used to show you're making progress toward your end-goal.
- Minimum 3 sources of data (2 should be original data created and collected by your group)
- Documentation of your hardware prototype
- At least one high-fidelity vizualization from your data
- A written overview of how you cleaned and handled your data (does not necessarily have to be part of your final presentation, but a write up of how you got rid of noise and how prepped it for final analysis will need to be submitted).

**Be Creative** I'm open to almost anything from living, breathing, data-driven art exhibitions to citizen science data collections to a cool infographic or even a standard research paper.  Whatever floats your boat, we'll try hard to make it work!
