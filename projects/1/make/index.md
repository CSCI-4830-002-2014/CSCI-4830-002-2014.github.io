# Workshop Making Session

## Before Coming

Please take a look at one of the following, pending which sensor you plan to use:  
[Sound Sensing Example](https://www.inkling.com/read/arduino-cookbook-michael-margolis-2nd/chapter-6/recipe-6-7)  
OR  
[Light Sensing Example](http://arduinobasics.blogspot.com/2011/06/arduino-uno-photocell-sensing-light.html)

Also be sure to have downloaded the arduino software to your computer: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

If you have the time, open up the arduino IDE and look at the sketchbook.  There is some sample code for sensors that will make things easier.

## At the workshop

You will receive your hardware and a breadboard.  The primary goal of the session will be to get your circuit set up such that it is receiving data.  If there is time, we will also work on getting the SD card working and fixing up any code necessary for solid data collection.

## After the workshop

You will then be responsible for showing that you have completed the workshop, have a working prototype that collects and saves data, and a test environment you plan to use for collection.

You must be done building your hardware no later than 11:59PM 9/7.  Your mini-project will be used the week following where your assignment will be to collect test data with your sensor.

## Submission
