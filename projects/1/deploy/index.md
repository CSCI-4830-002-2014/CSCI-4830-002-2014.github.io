# Deploy and Learn (50 points)
**Due 9/21**

I want to thank the students this week in class who were thinking faster than me regarding bit representations.  A big part of understanding data is knowing how it's being generated, thus we are going to look further into arduino.

 If you are feeling like you have no idea about how to think about sampling arduino [this link](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php/topic,156200.0.html) may be helpful.  It's a forum with some helpful back-and-forth for someone trying to learn to do audio sampling. 

Before beginning the homework, you should already have some data ready to look at.  Once you're ready to go, the questions and submission template can be found here:

### Extra Resources 

If you are among the people who are trying to detect tonal properties of sound, please look into the [Goertzel Algorithm](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/Goertzel)
